# Energy-Efficiency
In this prject ,
We will be doing thorough exploratory analysis for all the Feature columns using Matplotlib and seaborn.
We will be checking if there is any linear relationship in between feature columns and Target Variables using correlation matrix and Heatmap.
We will split the data into train and test sets using sklearn library.
We will create regression models to predict the target variables using Linear Regression and Random Forest methods and compare them.
